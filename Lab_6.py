To statr, we will generate a random interger between 1 and 20, and 
based on the result of the number, we check to see if it falls under certain range
if the number is greater than 15, then the result will be "Cherries"
otherwise if the number is > 10, then the result wil be "Orange"
otherwise if the number is > 10, then the result wil be "Plum"
otherwise if the number is > 10, then the result wil be "Melon"
otherwise if the number is > 10, then the result wil be "Bell"
if the number is not any of the above, then the reult will be "Bar"

we iterate over using a loop three times ab=nd print the reults to the user. An example "Plum Cherries"
